\section{About the Task}

\subsection{The Platform and the Data Source}

Our task is to finish a competition on \emph{kaggle}, which is a platform
for machine learning competitions. Specifically, our task is based on a
famous computer game called \emph{PLAYERUNKNOWNâ€™S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG)}.
In this game, 100 players will be dropped onto an island called Erangel
empty-handed. They must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until
only one of them is left standing, all while the play zone continues to
shrink.

\subsection{The Data}

We are given some anomymized player data from 65000 games. The data is split
into training set and testing set. In the training set, we have what a player
perform in each game in all aspects, like different kinds of killing, or the
moving distance on a car or under water. And also, we have a winning placement
percentage \textbf{winPlacePerc}, ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to
1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place. This percentage is the target of
the prediction. In the testing set, we have all of the columns in the training
set, except the \textbf{winPlacePer} column. Our task is to predict this column
as precise as possible. The final score is calculated by the mean absolute error
between the prediction and the groud-truth.

\section{Analysis and Motivation}

\subsection{Version 1}

For the given training data, we can see that it either describe the behavior of a player
or the metadata of a match. According to my experience of playing computer games when I
was a teenager, the final data of a match is strongly related to the match type.
For different match types, there are different rules and strategies, which may affect the
players' data like walking distance and killing count. So my first motivation is to
split the training set by different match types.

And also, during different matches, one player tend to perform differently. He may shoot
well in one game, while missing everything he shoot in another game. My second motivation
is to train a model for each game.

From the course \emph{Machine Learning}, I have learned about the power of ensemble learning.
So I tried to use all models of the same match type to predict a record from a corresponding
match type, and get an average value as the final result.

\subsection{Version 2}

In the algorithm of version 1, the data for training a model comes from a single game,
containing less than 100 rows, which is too few for training a model empirically.
So I tried to use more data for each model's generation. However, the amount of
data for each match type is totally different. As a result, for a match type with few
rows of data, it is impossible to train models with much data.

My solution is to train models with different types of model. I split the whole training
set into 100 parts, and use each part to train a model. While predicting a record, I 
use all of the 100 models to predict and use the average as the final result.

\section{Algorithm and Implementation}

\subsection{Version 1}

For the first version of my algorithm, I choose the following features: ["walkDistance",
"killStreaks", "rideDistance", "kills", "heals", "boosts", "damageDealt", "weaponsAcquired",
"headshotKills", "teamKills", "roadKills", "swimDistance", "revives", "assists", "killPlace",
"longestKill", "vehicleDestroys"]. The reason is that, these are all features describing a 
player, instead of a match. In my opinion, since I train a model for each match, the features
describing the match are meaningless, because they are all the same.

I choose \textbf{Decision Tree regressor} as the algorithm. The reason is that it can 
save the effort of decomposition, since I don't know which feature is more important for 
the result. It can judge the best feature for me.

In order to train a model from a match, I sorted the whole training data by match type and matchID.
For each matchID, I trained a model using all rows with this matchID, and added the model to the 
set of corresponding match type. During prediction, I used all the models of that match type 
to calculate a average result, which is an application of ensemble learning: considering
the matches are inherently independent to each other, the model trained by each match 
can do prediction independently.

Specifically, to speed up the prediction, for match types with much more data, which corresponds
to more models, I randomly sampled part of the models for prediction by a max predictor threshold.
Also, I implemented the program in a multi-processes way, 
which can fully utilize the multi-core CPU. The source code is available at my
\href{https://github.com/mrdrivingduck/pugb-finish-placement-prediction/blob/master/src/main_multi_process_version.py}{GitHub}.

\subsection{Version 2}

For the second version of algorithm, I trained 100 models with about 45000 rows of data each,
and used all models together to predict a record. I tried several ensumble learning algorithms,
including \textbf{XGBoost regressor}, \textbf{Random Forest regressor}, \textbf{AdaBoost regressor}
and \textbf{Gradient Boosting regressor}. They are all using ensemble method inside.
I integrated them together for the seconde time of emsemble learning.
The source code is available at my
\href{https://github.com/mrdrivingduck/pugb-finish-placement-prediction/blob/master/src/main_ensemble.py}{GitHub}.

\section{Results and Evaluation}

\subsection{Version 1}

For the version 1 algorithm, I tried different parameter of max predictor threshold.
If a match type contains more models than the threshold, then only models of the
threshold would get involved into the prediction.

At first, I introduced this parameter for speeding up the prection process. However,
according to the experiment, a greater threshold will not get a better score.
I used the threshold of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000. 1500 gets the following best score, while 1000
is not better than 500 and 2000 is not better than 1500.

  \includegraphics[height=2.4cm]{img/res-version-1.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Version 2}

For the version2 algorithm, I just tried different ensemble learning method:
\textbf{XGBoost regressor}, \textbf{Random Forest regressor}, \textbf{AdaBoost regressor}
and \textbf{Gradient Boosting regressor}, Among which Random Forest regressor 
got the following best score.

\section{Thoughts}

I didn't do much work about features, which should be an important part in machine learning.
In fact, 



\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Outline}

The document layout should follow the style of the journal concerned.
Where appropriate, sections and subsections should be added in the
normal way. If the class options are set correctly, warnings will be
given if these should not be present.

\subsection{References}

The class makes various changes to the way that references are
handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the
appropriate bibliography style.  References can be made using
the normal method; the citation should be placed before any
punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript
citation style
\cite{Mena2000,Abernethy2003,Friedman-Hill2003,EuropeanCommission2008}.
The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by
Ref.~\citenum{Mena2000}.  Long lists of authors will be
automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in
supplementary information or reviews \cite{Pople2003}. If you
encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that
your copy of \textsf{natbib} is up to date. The demonstration
database file \texttt{achemso-demo.bib} shows how to complete
entries correctly. Notice that ``\latin{et al.}'' is auto-formatted
using the \texttt{\textbackslash latin} command.

Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as
a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mciteplus} package
\cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo1994}.
Citations other than the first of the list should be indicated
with a star. If the \textsf{mciteplus} package is not installed,
the standard bibliography tools will still work but starred
references will be ignored. Individual references can be referred
to using \texttt{\textbackslash mciteSubRef}:
``ref.~\mciteSubRef{Eisenstein2005}''.

The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
this is not the case \cite[p.~1]{Cotton1999}.

\subsection{Floats}

New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
means graphics are included as follows (Scheme~\ref{sch:example}).  As
illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
\begin{scheme}
  Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
  for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
  \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files:\\
  these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
  converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
  %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \caption{An example scheme}
  \label{sch:example}
\end{scheme}

\begin{figure}
  As well as the standard float types \texttt{table}\\
  and \texttt{figure}, the class also recognises\\
  \texttt{scheme}, \texttt{chart} and \texttt{graph}.
  \caption{An example figure}
  \label{fgr:example}
\end{figure}

Charts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or
captioned.  However, tables should always have a title. It is
possible to include a number and label for a graphic without any
title, using an empty argument to the \texttt{\textbackslash caption}
macro.

The use of the different floating environments is not required, but
it is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In
general, you should place your graphics where they make logical
sense; the production process will move them if needed.

\subsection{Math(s)}

The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
support for mathematics.  If packages such as \textsf{amsmath} are
required, they should be loaded in the preamble.  However,
the basic \LaTeX\ math(s) input should work correctly without
this.  Some inline material \( y = mx + c \) or $ 1 + 1 = 2 $
followed by some display. \[ A = \pi r^2 \]

It is possible to label equations in the usual way (Eq.~\ref{eqn:example}).
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \, r^2 = 2r \label{eqn:example}
\end{equation}
This can also be used to have equations containing graphical
content. To align the equation number with the middle of the graphic,
rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.80\linewidth}
    \centering
    As illustrated here, the width of \\
    the minipage needs to allow some  \\
    space for the number to fit in to.
    %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \end{minipage}
  \label{eqn:graphic}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental}

The usual experimental details should appear here.  This could
include a table, which can be referenced as Table~\ref{tbl:example}.
Notice that the caption is positioned at the top of the table.
\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table}
  \label{tbl:example}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one  & Header two  \\
    \hline
    Entry one   & Entry two   \\
    Entry three & Entry four  \\
    Entry five  & Entry five  \\
    Entry seven & Entry eight \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest
method is to generate these using the basic
\texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} and
\texttt{\textbackslash emph} macros, as illustrated (Table~\ref{tbl:notes}).
\begin{table}
  \caption{A table with notes}
  \label{tbl:notes}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one                            & Header two \\
    \hline
    Entry one\textsuperscript{\emph{a}}   & Entry two  \\
    Entry three\textsuperscript{\emph{b}} & Entry four \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \textsuperscript{\emph{a}} Some text;
  \textsuperscript{\emph{b}} Some more text.
\end{table}

The example file also loads the optional \textsf{mhchem} package, so
that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ce\{H2SO4\}}
gives \ce{H2SO4}.  See the use in the bibliography file (when using
titles in the references section).

The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
not interfere with the production process.  For example,
\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example,
to give italic, mono-spaced text: \mycommand{some text}.

\section{Extra information when writing JACS Communications}

When producing communications for \emph{J.~Am.\ Chem.\ Soc.}, the
class will automatically lay the text out in the style of the
journal. This gives a guide to the length of text that can be
accommodated in such a publication. There are some points to bear in
mind when preparing a JACS Communication in this way.  The layout
produced here is a \emph{model} for the published result, and the
outcome should be taken as a \emph{guide} to the final length. The
spacing and sizing of graphical content is an area where there is
some flexibility in the process.  You should not worry about the
space before and after graphics, which is set to give a guide to the
published size. This is very dependant on the final published layout.

You should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS
Communication and a normal article.  For example, this demonstration
file will work with both \texttt{type=article} and
\texttt{type=communication}. Sections and any abstract are
automatically ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{tocentry}

Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
text is correct.

Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
Society}.

The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
separate page at the end of the document.
